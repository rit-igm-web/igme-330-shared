# Web Audio VI - Bitmap effects

## I. Overview

- `ctx.getImageData(x, y, width, height)` returns an array of RGBA values which we can manipulate in various ways, and then copy back to the canvas with `ctx.putImageData(x, y, width, height)`
- You have already had a chance to do this in [HW - Audio Visualizer - Part III](./HW-AV-2195-3.md) - so let's experiment with some additional effects we can apply
- In these examples we will be manipulating video frames that come from either a video file, or the user's webcam 

<hr>

## II. Getting `imageData` from video
- In the demos below we are:
  1) sampling the contents of a &lt;video> element or the user's Webcam 60 times a second
  2) copying the video source's current frame to a &lt;canvas> element with `ctx.drawImage()`
  3) getting a reference to the &lt;canvas> `imageData` (which is a `Uint8ClampedArray`) with `ctx.getImageData(x, y, width, height)`
  4) looping through this typed array, and modifying some of its values
  5) putting the modified array of data back onto the &lt;canvas> with `ctx.putImageData(x, y, width, height)`
- The source code and video files for these demo are NOT in myCourses, so be sure to:
  - follow along with the demos
  - "inspect" the source code of the demos to see how the various effects are accomplished
  - put in break points so that you can understand how the program flow works, as well as inspect the values of the variables

### II-A. Manipulating the image data of a video file

- Video Filters Example: https://people.rit.edu/~acjvks/330/shared/getImageData-putImageData-demo/video-image-data-demo-3.html
- Here we have the following effects - ***be sure to look over the source code to see how these effects are applied - it's pretty simple logic - actually***:
  - Invert (seen in AV - Part III)
  - Noise (seen in AV - Part III)
  - Emboss (seen in AV - Part III, and is a more interesting effect because the value of each pixel is dependent on neighboring pixels)
  - Tint
  - Desaturate
  - Sepia
  - Shift RGB (similar to Invert)

## III. Webcam input
- Below, we will grab the contents of the webcam and copy it to a &lt;canvas> element 60 times a second - no  &lt;video> element is required
- Below we are using [Navigator.getUserMedia()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/getUserMedia) to capture the webcam input - even though this method is deprecated it still works - but if you add webcam input to your project you should explore the newer methods
- These webcam examples only reliably work in Chrome - but if you investigate the newer methods you could get this working in other browsers too
- A possible enhancement to your project 2 would be to utilize the webcam as user input that would alter the visualizations (and maybe the sound) in certain ways

### III-A. Basic Example
- Webcam Example: https://people.rit.edu/~acjvks/330/shared/video/webcam-image-data-demo.html
- All of the image effects work as they did in Part II above, except now we have a live image to manipulate

### III-B. 
- Webcam plus Motion Detect Example: https://people.rit.edu/~acjvks/330/shared/video/webcam-image-data-demo-2.html
- Here we created a simple motion detecter by coloring a pixel red if any of its sub-pixels chnage my 15 or more units between frames

### III-C. 
- Webcam plus Face Detect Example: https://people.rit.edu/~acjvks/330/shared/video/webcam-image-data-demo-3.html
- There are 2 more filters ("Weird" and "Weirder") you might like
- Here we are using https://github.com/mtschirs/js-objectdetect, but the project is not active, there are some newer libraries you might like better:
  - https://trackingjs.com
  - https://hackernoon.com/tensorflow-js-real-time-object-detection-in-10-lines-of-code-baf15dfb95b2
  

### III-D. 
- Webcam sunglasses app: https://people.rit.edu/~acjvks/330/shared/video/JS-Object-Detect/js-objectdetect-master/examples/example_sunglasses_jquery.htm
- Ditto on III-C. above

### III-E. 
- Webcam head tracker app:  https://people.rit.edu/~acjvks/330/shared/headtracker/headtracker2.html
- Here we are grabbing the x,y,z of the user's head with this library: https://github.com/auduno/headtrackr
- There are a lot of interesting things you could do on Project 2 with such a capability
- This library has not been updated in a while - there may be a newer one you could use instead
- See the *Teachable Machine* demo link below

## IV.  Image filters done as matrix operations
- this subject could literally be an entire course, so we're just going to give you a demo for inspiration 
- the demo is located online at: https://people.rit.edu/~acjvks/330/shared/fotoshawp/fotoshawp-done.html
- the zipped folder of the completed version is located in myCourses
- this example was built off of an excellent article from here:
  - https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/imagefilters
- you can find an excellent overview of digital image processing here: 
  - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/dip/index.htm
